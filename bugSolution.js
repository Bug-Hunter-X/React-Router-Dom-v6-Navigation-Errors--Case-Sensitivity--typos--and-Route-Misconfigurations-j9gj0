To address the navigation issues, double-check all route definitions and their usage within the `to` prop of the Link component.  Ensure case sensitivity is considered and the paths are exactly as defined in your routes. For instance: 

```javascript
// Incorrect - Case mismatch
<Link to="/About">About Us</Link> 

// Correct
<Link to="/about">About Us</Link>

// Incorrect - Typo
<Link to="/abou">About Us</Link> 

// Correct
<Link to="/about">About Us</Link>

//In your route definitions:

//Incorrect
<Route path="/aboutt" element={<About />} />

//Correct
<Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
```
Additionally, consider using a linter or a tool to help identify potential issues in your route definitions. Comprehensive testing across various navigation scenarios is strongly recommended.
