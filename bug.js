In React Router Dom v6, a common issue arises when navigating to a route that doesn't exist or is not properly defined. This can manifest as unexpected behavior, rendering issues, or errors in the console.  For instance, if you have a route defined as `/about` but try to navigate to `/About` (case-sensitive), it won't render correctly. Another scenario is if you have a typo in the `to` prop of the `<Link>` component or a misconfiguration in your route definitions leading to a 404 or similar error. This is particularly tricky to debug when you have many nested routes.
