# React Router v6 Navigation Errors

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Router v6: unexpected navigation errors caused by typos, case sensitivity, and misconfigurations in route definitions.

## Problem
React Router v6 is case-sensitive.  Mistakes in defining routes or using the `to` prop in `<Link>` components can lead to routes not rendering or throwing unexpected errors.  Nested routes complicate debugging.

## Solution
Carefully review your route definitions for typos and ensure case consistency between your route definitions and navigation links. Use a consistent casing strategy throughout your application.   Thorough testing of different navigation scenarios is essential.
